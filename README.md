CONNECTTEL CHURN PROJECT

Problem Definition: Predicting Customer Churn and Proactively Winning Them Back.

Introduction: Unveiling the Enigma of Customer Churn: Understanding, Anticipating, and Conquering the Attrition Challenge. In the bustling landscape of modern business, where customer loyalty is the cornerstone of success, there exists a formidable adversary: customer churn. The silent yet relentless force that stealthily erodes profitability and undermines growth, customer churn remains an enigma that haunts businesses across industries. It is the unsettling departure of once-loyal patrons, the gradual fading of revenue streams, and the elusive puzzle that demands urgent attention.

In this dynamic and hypercompetitive marketplace, where customer expectations evolve at the speed of innovation, understanding the intricate dynamics of churn is paramount. Every churned customer represents not just a lost revenue opportunity, but a trove of invaluable insights waiting to be unearthed. Behind every departure lies a story—a tale of unmet expectations, unsatisfied needs, or unaddressed grievances. It is within these narratives that the keys to unlocking customer retention reside.

At the intersection of data science, behavioral psychology, and business strategy lies the promise of unraveling the mysteries of customer churn. By leveraging the power of advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and prescriptive insights, businesses can transcend the realm of mere speculation and proactively anticipate churn triggers. Armed with this foresight, they can deploy targeted interventions, personalized incentives, and strategic initiatives to stem the tide of attrition and foster enduring customer relationships.


Background:
ConnectTel telecommunication Company is a leading provider of mobile communication and internet service   in the Telecommunication sector. Retaining customers is crucial for the company's long-term success and profitability. However, the company has been experiencing a high rate of customer churn, where a significant number of customers discontinue their subscription or stop using the company's services.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning. By proactively identifying these customers, the company aims to implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention. In the context of confusion matrix, any model or group of models that will maximize the true positive (Knowing ahead of time more of the customers that likely to churn) and minimize the false negative (Having less of people we erroneously assumed to be loyal but are on their way out) is our best choice. 

Data:
The company has collected historical data on customer interactions, including demographic information, usage patterns, transaction history, customer tenure, type of contract, Monthly charges, customer support interactions, and other relevant features. The dataset includes both churned and active customers, with labels indicating whether each customer churned or not. Find below a detailed data dictionary:




DATA DICTIONARY
1. CustomerID: A unique identifier assigned to each telecom customer, enabling 
tracking and identification of individual customers.
2. Gender: The gender of the customer, which can be categorized as male, or 
female. This information helps in analyzing gender-based trends in 
customer churn.
3. SeniorCitizen: A binary indicator that identifies whether the customer is a senior citizen 
or not. This attribute helps in understanding if there are any specific 
churn patterns among senior customers.
4. Partner: Indicates whether the customer has a partner or not. This attribute helps 
in evaluating the impact of having a partner on churn behavior.
5. Dependents: Indicates whether the customer has dependents or not. This attribute 
helps in assessing the influence of having dependents on customer 
churn.
6. Tenure: The duration for which the customer has been subscribed to the telecom 
service. It represents the loyalty or longevity of the customer’s 
relationship with the company and is a significant predictor of churn.
7. PhoneService: Indicates whether the customer has a phone service or not. This attribute 
helps in understanding the impact of phone service on churn.
DATA DICTIONARY
8. MultipleLines: Indicates whether the customer has multiple lines or not. This attribute helps in analyzing 
the effect of having multiple lines on customer churn.
9. InternetService: Indicates the type of internet service subscribed by the customer, such as DSL, fiber optic, 
or no internet service. It helps in evaluating the relationship between internet service and 
churn.
10. OnlineSecurity: Indicates whether the customer has online security services or not. This attribute helps in 
analyzing the impact of online security on customer churn.
11. OnlineBackup: Indicates whether the customer has online backup services or not. This attribute helps in 
evaluating the impact of online backup on churn behavior.
12. DeviceProtection: Indicates whether the customer has device protection services or not. This attribute helps 
in understanding the influence of device protection on churn.
13. TechSupport: Indicates whether the customer has technical support services or not. This attribute helps 
in assessing the impact of tech support on churn behavior.
14. StreamingTV: Indicates whether the customer has streaming TV services or not. This attribute helps in 
evaluating the impact of streaming TV on customer churn.
15. StreamingMovies: Indicates whether the customer has streaming movie services or not. This attribute helps in understanding the influence 
 of streaming movies on churn behavior.
16. Contract: Indicates the type of contract the customer has, such as a month-to-month, one-year, or two-year contract. It is a crucial 
factor in predicting churn as different contract lengths may have varying impacts on customer loyalty.
17. PaperlessBilling: Indicates whether the customer has opted for paperless billing or not. This attribute helps in analyzing the effect of 
 paperless billing on customer churn.
18. PaymentMethod: Indicates the method of payment used by the customer, such as electronic checks, mailed checks, bank transfers, or credit 
cards. This attribute helps in evaluating the impact of payment methods on churn.
19. MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer on a monthly basis. It helps in understanding the relationship between monthly 
charges and churn behavior.
20. TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer over the entire tenure. It represents the cumulative revenue generated from the 
customer and may have an impact on churn.
21. Churn: The target variable indicates whether the customer has churned (canceled the service) or not. It is the main variable to 
predict in telecom customer churn analysis.
